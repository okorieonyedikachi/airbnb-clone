    "neighborhood_overview": "The flat is situated in one of London's most ideal locations - Islington.  Whilst being right in the middle of London, it is a leafy and picturesque residential neighbourhood with a superb high street literally on your door step. Upper Street houses some of the best restaurants in London with many bars, unique design shops, markets, coffee roasters as well as good old fashioned British Pubs practically on every corner. The area's beautifully restored old buildings make it a wonderful neighbourhood at any time of the year. Additionally to the shopping and strolling opportunities, there are also some nice parks such as Highbury Fields. Regents Canal is a mere 5 minute walk away and with its houseboats lining its 'shores' and the many cafes/ restaurants that have opened here, this is a very charming place for a Sunday walk or a morning jog.",
    "notes": null,
    "transit": "Angel Tube station (Zone 1) is just 2 minutes walk away, sandwiched between the City of London and Kings Cross/St Pancreas International Station. All major tourist attractions are a quick 15 minute tube journey away. The apartment is also ideally located to the hip areas of Hackney and Shoreditch.  Being so close to Kings Cross with direct trains to Paris makes this an ideal apartment for exploring London. There are also a number of different night buses connecting this apartment to pretty any area any time of the day.",
    "access": "The flat has a supper fast wifi internet connection in every room and a whole host of guide books to help plan the perfect stay in London. We have a small 'garden' in the front of the building which makes the main living spaces a wonderful place to be. We also have a washing machine should you need to use it during your stay.",
    "interaction": "I am a very attentive host and will always try to respond to questions/requests immediately. If I am not around during  your stay my family have a small hotel in the area so are always around to help if there are any problems. This also means that check in can be 24hours since keys simply need to be collected from the hotel.",
    "house_rules": "Please remember that you are living in somebody's flat and that there are local, working people in the building that go about their usual lives. Please respect that and keep noise & disruption at night to a minimum. There has been a lot of negative press lately, especially regarding Air BnB and tourists that stay in local people's homes and treat it like a party ground so please be a nice, discrete tourist and respect our home. Some other points to note: \u2022 If you're a smoker please smoke outside. \u2022 Switch off all electrical appliances and lights when you leave the flat. It's good for the environment, prevents fire incidents and keeps costs low which allows us to offer an even cheaper stay   \u2022 Please make an effort to recycle.",

Towards Vauxhall you can find some of the best Indian food London has to offer and the Tea House Theatre (along with having great events) has the best selection of cakes and a mean fry-up!   A short stroll to Clapham Common is where you can also find subline French cuisine at Trinity or Madeleine for tradit",

I will be in Turin(Italy) and Berlin(Germany) in the following two academic year(one place each year) because of the set of my program. So you can imagine that I am now struggling with the language of Italian and German at the same time! And here is some information about the language I know: Chinese(both Mandarin and Cantonese, at a mother tongue level), English(advanced), Italian(limited), French(extremely limited), Germany(beginner) so that you know in what language you can contact me. \r\n\r\nBasically I am a full-time student and a part-time traveler and adventurer. During the past half-year time, I visited Morocco and 14 UK cities(don't forget that I still have to spend most of my time attending lectures and seminars, preparing for presentations and exams)! I would say that I really love walking in cities as well as to some suburb areas(yeah I love it so much that my friend calls me a pioneer). Besides, I take horse-riding courses some of the time and now also preparing for driving tests. \r\n\r\nYou will find me a person that is nice and is always ready to offer help. I am not talkative most of the time, especially when meeting someone at the first few times but trust me I am not cold as I look like.",

    "neighborhood_overview": "Islington is a wonderfully eclectic blend of cool and established, young and old, long-time residents and newcomers. You can look at the AIRBNB neighbourhood guide for more details. Our flat is on a quiet tree-lined residential street just off Newington Green (North Islington). It's fairly central/urban, but the street is also very friendly - we know most of our neighbours.  Newington Green itself is a great mix of gentrified (i.e. trendy, expensive) and old school (betting shops, pound shops). Minutes from the flat you'll find a great greengrocer, a fish and chip shop, late-opening corner shops, fab cheap Turkish restaurants, plus cafes and pubs. We've marked many of these on our tailor-made online airbnb guidebook, a printout of which you'll find in the flat. Newly uber-trendy Dalston and the more established somewhat hippy chick/ yummy mummy Stoke Newington are within walking distance, as is Islington's famous Upper Street, and getting to central London is easy by bus or tube.",
    "notes": "Please fill in your profile and post a photo before submitting a reservation or making an enquiry. No third party bookings please - if you're booking you need to be the person staying here, it's an AIRBNB requirement. We offer flexible check in and check out but please consult us before booking travel which will mean you arrive early (before 11am) or late (after 8pm). Same applies for a late check out (after midday) though usually that's not a problem - you can leave your bags and collect them later or even stay in the flat if we aren't back until late ourselves.  Please note we allow smoking in the (very well-aired) flat so if you are sensitive to any lingering trace of cigarette smoke, you may prefer somewhere else.",
    "transit": "The nearest tube station is Canonbury (6 - 8 mins walk), on the fast and frequent London Overground. Canonbury to Camden Road (for Camden Market) is 7 mins; Hampstead Heath, a glorious huge park, is about 20 mins away; Shoreditch High Street (for Brick Lane) is 9 mins. Oxford Circus is 20 mins away, with one change at Highbury & Islington. The Olympic Park and Westfield - a huge shopping mall at Stratford - are 15 minutes away, again on the Overground. South Kensington Tube Station - for the V & A, Natural History Museum, Science Museum and Hyde Park - is approx 30 mins by Overground and tube. Local buses serve the City & London Bridge, Waterloo & the South Bank, Soho, Piccadilly, Victoria and Oxford Street to name but a few. We provide tube maps, general transport info, hand-drawn maps of the local area and fold-out pocket maps of London in the AIRBNB drawer in our flat to help you find your way around easily. If you want advice on where to go/how to get there, don't hesitate to ask u",
    "access": "There are a few steps up to the flat. Shared entrance hall, own front door.",
    "interaction": "The flat will be cleaned and ready for you -  with crisp clean linen on the bed and freshly-laundered towels in the bathroom. We greet you, show you the essentials (how the heating works for example) then give you the keys and leave you to enjoy your stay. On check out you simply lock up, put the keys in the padded envelope provided and pop them through the letterbox. We are available by mobile during your time with us to answer any questions or solve any problems that may arise.",
    "house_rules": "Please treat our flat with love and care - it's our home not a professional rental.  We only have a few specific rules as follows: No smoking in the bedroom No visitors except by prior arrangement No loud music after 11pm Nothing to be left in the communal hallway Please make sure the main front door is locked at all times Otherwise make yourselves at home and have a very lovely time :)",

We also love going away in our 1972 VW camper van which, despite its advanced age, has managed to get us to Sweden, Denmark, Germany, France and the Netherlands.\r\n\r\nWe have used airbnb as guests since 2009 and stayed in some great places in Berlin, Istanbul, New York, Lisbon, Rome and Barcelona among others. We've enjoyed meeting some great hosts too. We are super tidy, reliable and considerate of other people's places.\r\n\r\nWe are now hosting as we want to get away more often and it makes sense not to leave the flat empty. Since we started hosting we have welcomed guests from all over the world - Spain, Germany, Switzerland, Denmark, France, Italy, the US and Australia - as well as from all over the UK\r\n\r\nWhat do we particularly love about hosting? Meeting some truly lovely people, making them feel at home, discovering how respectful people are of our flat and knowing that we have contributed to them having a great stay in London.",

Why am I in Barcelona?\r\nI lived in London with Marta in one house, she is from Barca and she invited me to Sonar.\r\n\r\nI am traveling in the moment as much is possible, so I thought going to Barcelona is a great opportunity to alive a different culture, in a very beautiful und interesting city. Here we go, I am right now in Barcelona searching a room in a flat/house. It would be great to live with local people. I really want to explore Barcelona and be a part of the Catalan culture.\r\n\r\nDuring my stay in Barcelona I will plan my move to Berlin for working. I will also continue improving my english with conversation-exchange.\r\n\r\nI have planned my flight back to Germany on the 6. of August and I could move in as soon as possible.\r\nIf you are interested feel free to contact me.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m looking forward to hearing from you, Seb :)",

Brixton is a wonderful place, even though of course it is changing dramatically with the influx of more and more wealthy people, it is losing some of its multiethnic, creative and vibrant rough liveliness. Nonetheless it is still a great place to live and of course visit. The flat is at what used to be known as the 'front line' during the Brixton riots in the 1980s. Now you will not notice any of this, but if you are interested check out some historic facts about Brixton.  We also live very close to Brixton Market, where you can buy fruit and vegetable from all over the world, as well as local produce. Brixton pretty much has got everything you need for a great city break. Restaurants, night life, you name it. Lots of nice outdoor areas. Brockwell Park is less than 5 min walk away.",

If you come via Gatwick airport you can take a train to Clapham Junction and then hop on the 37 bus which drops you less than 5 minutes from the house on the corner of Effra Parade.",
